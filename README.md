# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample smart contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and a basic react frontend to interact with the smart contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

## For restarting the dApp
`npx hardhat node`
Create a local testnetwork

`npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js`
Deploy smart contract on testnetwork.

`npm start`
Open React App.
